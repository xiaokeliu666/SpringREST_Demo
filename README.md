# SpringREST_Demo
Implemented CRUD with RESTful api.
# Test
Since there are only backend programs in thie repository, Postman is required to do the test.
**Note**
In order to test HTTP method like delete, put and post, requestbody should be input manually in Postman in JSON. For more detail about REST, please refer to my blog.
